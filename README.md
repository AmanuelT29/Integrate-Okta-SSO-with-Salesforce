#  Okta SSO Integration with Salesforce


## Platform and Tools Used


## Objective

In this project, I demonstrate how to integrate Okta Single Sign-On (SSO) with the Salesforce application. The process begins by creating four new users in both Okta and Salesforce. Next, I create a "Marketing" group in Okta and assign the users to this group to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). I then configure the Salesforce application in Okta and set up SSO integration. Finally, I assign the Marketing group to the Salesforce application, granting users access and ensuring a successful SSO implementation.

### Create Users and Group on Okta

1. Started by adding new users **Monisha** and **Oly**, and followed the same process for the remaining users.
